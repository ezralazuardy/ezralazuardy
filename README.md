### hello world 👋

it's me, an _egocentric_; polyglot software engineer who know nothing, can't do anything, and yet still don't know how the system actually works. i don't do skill measurement by badge; judge my skill by repos i've published.

i like to write about tech stuff, most of my writings are published at [medium](https://ezralazuardy.medium.com).

a bit about me:

- 🦉 a night owl
- 🎮 dota 2
- 🧑‍🎓 undergraduate [computer engineering student](https://ft.undip.ac.id/en/site/) (average gpa `3.8`)
- ☕ black / americano; no sugar
- 👨‍💻 kotlin / php / js / py / rust / go / elixir
- 🚀 fullstack, but prefer backend
- 🔥 fav. stack: laravel vue inertia, mevn
- 🌟 fav. stuff: reverse engineering, astronomy, astrophysics

workspace:

- 📀 elementaryOS 6.1 Jolnir
- 💻 ec2047AX / ryzen 5 / nvidia geforce gtx 1050
- 🖱️ razer basilisk ultimate / razer firefly v2
- ⌨️ razer huntsman te (linear switch)
- 🐋 docker as dev env / k8s

fun fact, [ezra](https://namamia.com/nama-bayi/ezra.html) [lazuardy](https://namamia.com/nama-bayi/lazuardy.html) means "_a helper from the horizon_".

ps; contact me via [email](mailto:ezralazuardy@students.undip.ac.id) to ask for detailed resume and portofolio.
