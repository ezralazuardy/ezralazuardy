![Ezra Lazuardy's Cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezralazuardy/ezralazuardy/main/assets/cover-skeleton.png)

it's me, an _egocentric_; polyglot software engineer who know nothing, can't do anything, and yet still don't know how the system actually works. i love to write about tech stuff, most of them are published at [medium](https://ezralazuardy.medium.com). i speak kotlin / php / ts / py / go / rust / elixir.

fun fact, [ezra](https://namamia.com/nama-bayi/ezra.html) [lazuardy](https://namamia.com/nama-bayi/lazuardy.html) means "_a helper from the horizon_".
