### hello world 👋

it's me, an _egocentric_; polyglot software engineer who know nothing, can't do anything,<br/>and yet still don't know how the system actually works.

a bit about me:

- 🧑‍🎓 undergraduate [computer engineering student](https://ft.undip.ac.id/en/site/) (average gpa `3.8`)
- ☕ black / americano; no sugar
- 🎮 dota 2
- 👨‍💻 kotlin / php / js / rust / go / elixir
- 🗄️ sql-based enjoyer
- 🚀 fullstack, but prefer backend
- 🔥 fav. stack: laravel vue inertia / mevn
- 🌟 fav. stuff: reverse engineering, astronomy, astrophysics

specs:

- 📀 elementaryOS 6.1 Jolnir
- 💻 ec2047AX / ryzen 5 / nvidia geforce gtx 1050
- 🖱️ razer basilisk ultimate / razer firefly v2
- ⌨️ razer huntsman te (linear switch)
- 🐋 docker `v20`

i dont do skill measurement by badge; judge me by repos i've published.

ps; contact me via [email](mailto:ezralazuardy@students.undip.ac.id) to ask for detailed resume and portofolio.
