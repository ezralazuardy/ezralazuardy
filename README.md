### hello world 👋

it's me, an _egocentric_; polyglot software engineer who know nothing, can't do anything, and yet still don't know how the system actually works. i like to write about tech stuff, most of my writings are published at [medium](https://ezralazuardy.medium.com).

fun fact, [ezra](https://namamia.com/nama-bayi/ezra.html) [lazuardy](https://namamia.com/nama-bayi/lazuardy.html) means "_a helper from the horizon_".

- 🦉 a night owl
- 🚀 fullstack, but prefer backend
- 🔥 laravel vue inertia / mevn
- 👨‍💻 kotlin / php / js / py / go / rust / elixir
- ☕ black / americano; no sugar
- 🌟 admiring reverse engineering, astronomy, astrophysics
- 🧑‍🎓 undergraduate [computer engineering student](https://ft.undip.ac.id/en/site/) (average gpa `3.8`)
